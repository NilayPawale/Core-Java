# Array Memory Storage

Internally, Arrays are like objects. Thatâ€™s why they are created using new operator. Array objects can hold two types of data.

1) Primitive type of data

2) References to derived type of data.

## Array Containing Primitive Type Of Data

```
public class ArraysInJava
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int[] a;           //Declaring int type array reference variable which will be referring to int type array object
 
        a = new int[5];    //Creating an int type Array Object containing 5 elements of int type
 
        a[1] = 10;         //Changing Value of element at index 1
 
        a[3] = 20;         //Changing Value of element at index 3
    }
}
```

In the above example, 
- First statement of main method (Line 5) declares an array reference variable of int type. 
- In the next statement, an array object containing 5 elements of int type is created and assigned to already declared array reference variable. 
- Initially, all elements of array are initialized with default values (i.e 0 in this example). 
- In the next statement (Line 9), Value of element at index 1 is changed to 10. 
- In the next statement, value of element at index 3 is changed to 20. 

This can be well explained with the diagram like below.

## Array Containing References To Derived Type Of Data 

```
class A
{
    int i;
}
 
public class ArraysInJava
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        A[] a;           //Declaring array reference variable of A-type which will be referring to an array object containing references to A-type objects
 
        a = new A[5];    //Creating an Array Object containing 5 references to A-type objects
 
        a[1] = new A();         //Creating an object of A-type and assigning it to element at index 1
 
        a[3] = new A();         //Creating an object of A-type and assigning it to element at index 3
    }
}
```

In the above example, 
- first statement of main method (Line 10) declares an array reference variable of class A-type. 
- This array reference variable must refer to an array object holding references to class A-type objects. 
- In the next statement, one array object which can hold 5 references to class A-type objects is created. Remember that, in this statement only an array object is created not 5 objects of class A-type are created . 
- Initially, all elements of array will be pointing to null. 
- In the next two statements (Line 14 and 16), two objects of class A-type are created and assigned to elements at index 1 and 3 respectively. 

It can be represented using diagram like below.
