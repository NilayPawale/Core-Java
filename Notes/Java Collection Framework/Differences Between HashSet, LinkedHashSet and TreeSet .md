# Differences Between HashSet, LinkedHashSet and TreeSet 

|                                       | HashSet                                                                 | LinkedHashSet                                                           | TreeSet                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **How they work internally?**         | HashSet uses HashMap internally to store its elements.                   | LinkedHashSet uses LinkedHashMap internally to store its elements.       | TreeSet uses TreeMap internally to store its elements.                   |
| **Order Of Elements**                 | HashSet doesn’t maintain any order of elements.                          | LinkedHashSet maintains insertion order of elements.                     | TreeSet orders the elements according to supplied Comparator or natural order. |
| **Performance**                       | HashSet gives better performance than LinkedHashSet and TreeSet.         | LinkedHashSet is slightly slower than HashSet due to maintaining insertion order. | TreeSet gives less performance due to sorting the elements after each operation. |
| **Insertion, Removal And Retrieval Operations** | HashSet gives performance of order O(1).                           | LinkedHashSet also gives performance of order O(1).                      | TreeSet gives performance of order O(log(n)) for insertion, removal, and retrieval. |
| **How they compare the elements?**    | HashSet uses `equals()` and `hashCode()` to remove duplicates.           | LinkedHashSet uses `equals()` and `hashCode()` to remove duplicates.     | TreeSet uses `compare()` or `compareTo()` methods for comparison.        |
| **Null elements**                     | HashSet allows maximum one null element.                                 | LinkedHashSet also allows maximum one null element.                      | TreeSet doesn’t allow null elements and throws `NullPointerException` if attempted. |
| **Memory Occupation**                 | HashSet uses less memory as it uses HashMap internally.                  | LinkedHashSet uses more memory as it uses LinkedList and HashMap.        | TreeSet uses the most memory as it sorts elements using Comparator and TreeMap. |
| **When To Use?**                      | Use HashSet if you don’t want to maintain any order of elements.         | Use LinkedHashSet if you want to maintain insertion order of elements.   | Use TreeSet if you want to sort elements according to some Comparator.   |
