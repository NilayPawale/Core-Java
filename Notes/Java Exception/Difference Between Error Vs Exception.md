# Difference Between Error Vs Exception in Java

- Both java.lang.Error and java.lang.Exception classes are sub classes of java.lang.Throwable class, but there exist some significant differences between them. 
- java.lang.Error class represents the errors which are mainly caused by the environment in which application is running. 
- For example, OutOfMemoryError occurs when JVM runs out of memory or StackOverflowError occurs when stack overflows. 
- Where as java.lang.Exception class represents the exceptions which are mainly caused by the application itself. 
- For example, NullPointerException occurs when an application tries to access null object or ClassCastException occurs when an application tries to cast incompatible class types.

## Differences Between Error Vs Exception In Java

1) Recovering

- Recovering from Error is not possible. 
- The only solution to errors is to terminate the execution. 
- Where as you can recover from Exception by using either try-catch blocks or throwing exception back to caller.

2) Handling

- You will not be able to handle the Errors using try-catch blocks. 
- Even if you handle them using try-catch blocks, your application will not recover if they happen. 
- On the other hand, Exceptions can be handled using try-catch blocks and can make program flow normal if they happen.
- Error cannot be controlled. Exception can be controlled.

3) Checked and Un-Checked

- Exceptions in java are divided into two categories â€“ checked and unchecked. 
- Where as all Errors belongs to only one category i.e unchecked.

4) Relation with Compiler

- Compiler will not have any knowledge about unchecked exceptions which include Errors and sub classes of RunTimeException because they happen at run time. 
- Where as compiler will have knowledge about checked Exceptions. 
- Compiler will force you to keep try-catch blocks if it sees any statements which may throw checked exceptions.

5) Relation

- Exceptions are related to application where as Errors are related to environment in which application is running.


## Difference Table

| Errors | Exceptions |
|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| Errors in Java are of type java.lang.Error. | Exceptions in Java are of type java.lang.Exception. |
| All errors in java are unchecked type. | Exceptions include both checked as well as unchecked type. |
| Errors happen at run time. They will not be known to compiler. | Checked exceptions are known to compiler where as unchecked exceptions are not known to compiler because they occur at run time. |
| It is impossible to recover from errors. | You can recover from exceptions by handling them through try-catch blocks. |
| Errors are mostly caused by the environment in which application is running. | Exceptions are mainly caused by the application itself. |
| Examples :
java.lang.StackOverflowError, java.lang.OutOfMemoryError | Examples :
Checked Exceptions : SQLException, IOException
Unchecked Exceptions : ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException, ClassCastException, NullPointerException |
