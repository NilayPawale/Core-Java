# Java Tokens

Java tokens are the smallest individual units of a Java program. These tokens are the building blocks of a Java program. There are five types of Java tokens:

- Keywords
- Identifiers
- Literals
- Operators
- Separators

### Keywords

- Keywords are reserved words that have predefined meanings in Java. 
- These words cannot be used as identifiers (variable names or method names). 
- Examples of keywords include class, public, static, void, if, else, etc

### Identifiers

Identifiers are names given to classes, methods, variables, etc. in a Java program. They must follow certain rules: 

- They cannot start with a digit. 
- They can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. 
- They cannot be Java keywords. 
- They are case sensitive

### Literals

Literals represent constant values that are used in Java. There are different types of literals: 

- Integer literals (e.g., 10, 0xFF) 
- Floating - point literals (e.g., 3.14, 2.5f) 
- Boolean literals (true and false) 
- Character literals (e.g., 'a', '5') 
- String literals (e.g., "Hello", "Java")

### Operators

- Operators perform operations on variables and values. 
- Examples include arithmetic operators (+,-, *, /), assignment operators (=, +=, operators (&&, ||, !), etc.

### Separators

- Separators are characters used to separate tokens in a Java program. 
- Examples include parentheses (), braces {}, square brackets [], commas ,, semicolons ;, etc.
