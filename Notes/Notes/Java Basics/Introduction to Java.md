# Introduction to Java

- Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) in 1995. 
- It's designed to be platform independent, meaning that Java programs can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

## Features of Java

- Simple: Java was designed to be easy to learn and use. 
- Object Oriented: Java supports the principles of object oriented programming (OOP), including abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. 
- Platform Independent: Java programs can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it highly portable. 
- Secure: Java's security features help protect against viruses and other malicious software. 
- Robust: Java is designed to be robust and reliable, with features like automatic memory management (garbage collection) to help prevent common programming errors. 
- Multithreaded: Java supports multithreading, allowing programs to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. 
- Architecture - Neutral: Java's architecture neutral design allows it to run on a variety of hardware platforms. 
- Dynamic: Java supports dynamic loading of classes, which allows programs to load classes on demand.
