# First Java Program

```
class Hello
{
     public static void main(String args[])
     {
          System.out.println("Hello World");
     }
}
```

In the above program,

1) class is a keyword. Every keyword in java should be in lowercase.

2) Hello is our class name. First letter of class name should be in uppercase. It is not a condition but it is just a convention.

3) public, static and void all are keywords.

4) main is a method name. Method name must be in lowercase. main method is a special method because execution of a java program starts from main method. This method takes one argument of type String array. Remember main is not a keyword.

5) String is a final class from java.lang package.

6) System is also a final class from java.lang package. out is a static member of System class of type PrintStream. println is a method of PrintStream class.

7) Above program prints “Hello World” on the console.
