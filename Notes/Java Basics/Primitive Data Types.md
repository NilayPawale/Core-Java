# Primitive Data Types

A primitive data type specifies the size and type of variable values, and it has no additional methods.

Java supports eight primitive data types, which are divided into four categories:

- Integer Types: byte, short, int, long
- Floating Point Types: float, double 
- Character Type: char 
- Boolean Type: Boolean 

Each primitive data type has a predefined size and range of values, as well as default values

| Data Type | Size | Description |
|:--------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| byte         | 1 byte         | Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127 |
| short | 2 bytes | Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767 |
| int | 4 bytes | Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 |
| long | 8 bytes | Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |
| float | 4 bytes | Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits |
| double | 8 bytes | Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits |
| boolean | 1 bit | Stores true or false values |
| char | 2 bytes | Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values |
